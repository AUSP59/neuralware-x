**Project:** NEURALWARE-X  
**Maintainer contact:** @AUSP59 — <alanursapu@gmail.com>  
**Effective date:** 2025-09-01

This Code of Conduct defines the standards of behavior for everyone who engages with the NEURALWARE-X community—maintainers, contributors, users, sponsors, and partners—across all spaces (GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, documentation, chats, events, and any project-branded venues).

## Our values

We strive to build a community that is:

- **Welcoming & inclusive.** We respect people of every background and identity.  
- **Kind & constructive.** We critique ideas, not individuals, and provide helpful, actionable feedback.  
- **Professional & safe.** We keep interactions civil, avoid harassment, and protect community members’ safety.  
- **Accountable.** We take responsibility for our words and actions and learn from mistakes.  
- **Transparent.** We communicate clearly, disclose conflicts of interest, and act with integrity.

---

## Scope

This Code applies to all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project in public.
Examples include: repositories under the project org or namespace, issues/PRs, code reviews, discussions, documentation, official social channels, community meetings, and events.

---

## Expected behavior

- Be **respectful** and assume good intent.  
- Provide **constructive feedback**; be specific and actionable.  
- Use **inclusive language** and be mindful of cultural and accessibility differences.  
- Respect **boundaries** (time, attention, topic); keep discussions on scope.  
- Follow project **processes** (issue/PR templates, contribution guidelines, security reporting).  
- **Protect privacy**: do not share private communications or personal information without consent.

## Unacceptable behavior

- **Harassment** or discrimination in any form (including sexist, racist, ableist, ageist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, or religiously discriminatory behavior).  
- **Personal attacks**, insults, or demeaning comments.  
- **Threats** or incitement of violence.  
- **Unwanted sexual attention** or advances.  
- **Trolling**, deliberate disruption, off-topic spamming, or derailment of discussions.  
- **Doxxing** or disclosure of others’ private information.  
- **Sabotage**, including intentionally introducing security vulnerabilities or bypassing project safeguards.  
- **Abuse of power**, conflicts of interest not disclosed, or retaliation against reporters.

## Reporting violations

If you experience or witness a violation:

- Prefer **private reporting** via **<alanursapu@gmail.com>** (include “CoC report” in the subject).  
- Alternatively, contact **@AUSP59** via GitHub (Direct Message or by requesting a private email in an issue, without detailing the incident publicly).

**What to include (if possible):**
- Your contact details (to follow up).  
- Description of the incident with **dates**, **locations/URLs**, and **people involved**.  
- Any relevant context or supporting material (screenshots, links).  

We will **acknowledge** receipt within **72 hours** (business days), keep reports **confidential**, and only involve people necessary to resolve the issue. We will inform you of the **next steps**, timelines, and the **outcome** where appropriate.

> If you believe you are in immediate danger, contact local emergency services. This project is not an emergency service.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. When a violation is identified, maintainers will take any action they deem appropriate, including **temporary or permanent** restrictions.

**Enforcement guidelines** (indicative, not exhaustive):

1. **Correction**  
   - *Community impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
   - *Consequence:* Private or public guidance; requested correction and reminder of standards.

2. **Warning**  
   - *Community impact:* A single incident or pattern of behavior that breaches the Code after initial feedback.  
   - *Consequence:* Official warning; potential requirements (apology, training, removal of content).

3. **Temporary restrictions**  
   - *Community impact:* Sustained inappropriate behavior; harassment; significant disruption.  
   - *Consequence:* Temporary **ban** from community spaces and/or contribution privileges; conditions for reinstatement.

4. **Permanent restrictions**  
   - *Community impact:* Severe violations, including threats of violence, doxxing, or sustained harassment.  
   - *Consequence:* Permanent **ban** from community spaces and/or contribution privileges.

**Appeals:** If you believe an action was made in error, you may appeal by emailing **<alanursapu@gmail.com>** with a clear explanation and any supporting context. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved in the initial action when possible.

**Non-retaliation:** Retaliation against anyone who reports an incident or participates in an investigation is itself a violation and will be treated seriously.
